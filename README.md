# Nykka Rumbaoa

Hey there!

I'm Nykka! Excited to have you here! I've spent the majority of my professional journey as a hardware engineer, but I'm making a shift into the world of data analytics. Yep, you guessed it â€“ lots of time wrangling data in Excel!

I've been on a learning spree, diving into certification courses from the likes of Google and Microsoft. They've given me the lowdown on Tableau, Microsoft BI, and the ins and outs of being a data analyst. Super cool stuff!

My big dream? To dive into the AI field as a data scientist. The possibilities of what AI can do in the future totally fascinate me. ðŸš€

I'm all about learning and making friends in the analytics community. So, thank you for stopping by! Feel free to poke around my repos, and if you're up for it, let's connect!
